# Dynamic Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying

This repository demonstrates a common issue when using Tailwind CSS with dynamic class manipulation in JavaScript.  Sometimes, classes added or removed via JavaScript don't update the element's styling as expected.  This can be due to various reasons, including incorrect class names, timing issues with the JavaScript execution and Tailwind's processing, or conflicts with other CSS.

**The bug:**  The provided JavaScript code attempts to add a Tailwind CSS class ('bg-red-500' in this case) to a DOM element dynamically. However, in certain scenarios, this class might not be applied correctly, leading to unexpected visual results.

**The solution:** Demonstrates how to ensure that Tailwind CSS updates correctly when dynamically manipulating classes.
